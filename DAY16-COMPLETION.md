## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Conversation Manager Architecture
```javascript
// Enhanced conversation state tracking
await conversationManager.trackConversationState(negotiationId, {
  participants: { buyer: buyerId, seller: sellerId },
  currentRound: 3,
  status: 'active',
  lastActivity: new Date(),
  context: { branch: 'main', scenario: 'price_negotiation' }
});

// Advanced message filtering
const messages = await conversationManager.getMessageHistory(negotiationId, {
  limit: 50,
  sender: userId,
  messageType: 'offer',
  dateRange: { start: '2024-01-01', end: '2024-01-31' },
  branch: 'main',
  includeContext: true
});

// Conversation branching
const branch = await conversationManager.createConversationBranch(
  negotiationId, 
  'alternative_scenario', 
  'scenario',
  'main'
);
```

### Analytics Integration
```javascript
// Generate comprehensive insights
const insights = await conversationAnalytics.generateInsights(negotiationId, [
  'sentiment', 'behavior', 'performance', 'prediction'
]);

// Sentiment analysis with trend tracking
const sentiment = insights.sentiment;
console.log(`Overall: ${sentiment.overall}, Trend: ${sentiment.trend}`);

// Performance metrics
const performance = insights.performance;
console.log(`Response time: ${performance.averageResponseTime}ms`);
```

### Export and Sharing
```javascript
// Multi-format export
const exportData = await conversationController.exportConversation(req, res);
// Supports: JSON, CSV, PDF, TXT, HTML

// Secure sharing with privacy controls
const shareLink = await conversationController.shareConversation(req, res);
// Privacy levels: public, private, anonymous
```
