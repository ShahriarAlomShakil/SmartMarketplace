# Frontend Startup Issues - Resolution Guide

## Problem Identified ✅

The frontend was experiencing startup issues where the Next.js development server would show the startup message but then immediately exit, returning to the command prompt.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by npx trying to install a newer version of Next.js (15.3.4) instead of using the locally installed version (14.0.4). This caused the development server to exit during the installation prompt.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed npm Scripts** ✅
Updated `package.json` to include both standard and safe fallback scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --port 3001",
    "dev-safe": "node_modules/.bin/next dev --port 3001",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start --port 3001"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Port Configuration** ✅
- Changed default port from 3000 to 3001 to avoid conflicts
- Updated `next.config.js` and `dev-start.sh` accordingly

### 3. **Multiple Startup Methods**
Now you can start the frontend using any of these methods:

```bash
# Method 1: Standard npm script (now working)
npm run dev

# Method 2: Safe fallback script
npm run dev-safe

# Method 3: Direct binary execution
node_modules/.bin/next dev --port 3001

# Method 4: Project startup script
cd .. && ./dev-start.sh
```

## Current Status ✅

- ✅ Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ Development server stays alive and responsive
- ✅ Hot reloading works correctly
- ✅ Browser can access the application
- ✅ Multiple startup methods available as fallbacks

## Testing Verification

The following tests were performed:
1. ✅ `npm run dev` - Works correctly
2. ✅ Server stays running (doesn't exit immediately)
3. ✅ Website accessible at http://localhost:3001
4. ✅ Simple Browser can load the page
5. ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
6. ✅ No dependency issues

## If Issues Persist

If you encounter startup issues in the future:

1. **Check if port is available:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

2. **Use the troubleshooting script:**
   ```bash
   ./frontend-troubleshoot.sh
   ```

3. **Try the safe fallback:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev-safe
   ```

4. **Clear Next.js cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes

- The issue was specifically with npx version resolution
- Local Next.js installation (14.0.4) works perfectly
- The solution maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
