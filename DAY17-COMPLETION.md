## 🔍 **Security Enhancements Details**

### **Password Security:**
```javascript
// Enhanced password requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters, maximum 128
- Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters required
- No common weak patterns (123456, password, etc.)
- No repeated characters (more than 3 in a row)
- No sequential patterns (abc, 123, etc.)
- Password strength scoring (0-100)
- History of last 5 passwords prevented
```

### **Account Protection:**
```javascript
// Multi-layer protection:
- 5 failed attempts = 2-hour account lock
- IP-based rate limiting
- Email notifications for security events
- Device tracking for refresh tokens
- Automatic session timeout
- Force logout capability
```

### **Monitoring & Detection:**
```javascript
// Real-time security monitoring:
- Suspicious request pattern detection
- Multiple user agent tracking
- High-frequency request alerts
- Security event logging
- Performance monitoring
```
